Yii 2 shop example project
==========================

This is an example project implementing a shop created to help people learn Yii 2.0. It was created during 8 hours workshop performed in Ekaterinburg, Russia. The idea was to show how to deal with Gii, grids, filtering and other Yii 2.0 usage. It is by no means a complete shop script. It may contain bugs, shortcuts etc.

> If you want to take over the project and develop it further, let @samdark know and you'll be granted permissions required.

There are slides from the workshop in Russian: http://slides.rmcreative.ru/2014/yii2-master/

It is built on top of advanced template which includes three tiers: front end, back end, and console, each of which
is a separate Yii application.
